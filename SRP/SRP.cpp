// SRP.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
// 1. Single Responsibility Principle
// This principle states that ¡°A class should have only one reason to change¡± 
// which means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose.
// In other words, a class should have only one job or purpose within the software system.
// Let¡¯s understand Single Responsibility Principle using an example :
//  Imagine a baker who is responsible for baking bread.The baker¡¯s role is to focus on the task of baking bread, ensuring that the bread is of high quality, properly baked, and meets the bakery¡¯s standards.
// However, if the baker is also responsible for managing the inventory, ordering supplies, serving customers, and cleaning the bakery, this would violate the SRP.
// Each of these tasks represents a separate responsibility, and by combining them, the baker¡¯s focus and effectiveness in baking bread could be compromised.
// To adhere to the SRP, the bakery could assign different roles to different individuals or teams.For example, there could be a separate person or team responsible for managing the inventory, another for ordering supplies, another for serving customers, and another for cleaning the bakery.
// 
// BreadBaker Class : Responsible solely for baking bread.This class focuses on ensuring the quality and standards of the bread without being burdened by other tasks.
// InventoryManager Class : Handles inventory management, ensuring that the bakery has the right ingredients and supplies available.
// SupplyOrder Class : Manages ordering supplies, ensuring that the bakery is stocked with necessary items.
// CustomerService Class : Takes care of serving customers, providing a focused approach to customer interactions.
// BakeryCleaner Class : Responsible for cleaning the bakery, ensuring a hygienic environment.
