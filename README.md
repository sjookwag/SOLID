The SOLID principles are five essential guidelines that enhance software design, making code more maintainable and scalable. They include Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. In this article, we’ll explore each principle with real-life examples, highlighting their significance in creating robust and adaptable software systems. These five principles are:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open/Closed Principle
3. Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
